# Lo-Fi Player

Welcome to our “Lo-Fi Player” room! By interacting with elements in the room, you can build your own custom music stream. Or if you prefer, just relax, listen, and enjoy the view from the window. The experience is powered by machine learning models from [magenta.js](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-js).

For many it’s more fun to play around with the room without an instruction guide, so you might [try yourself](https://magenta.github.io/lofi-player/) before reading further (or watch it on [YouTube stream](https://magenta.github.io/lofi-player/stream)). Just click on the image above and Lo-Fi Player will start in a different browser tab. One hint: once the music starts, the green ceiling lamp can be used to stop it. Please read the [blog](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/lofi-player) if you want to know more about the project.
